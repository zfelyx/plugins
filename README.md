# Pelican Plugins

A curated list of plugins for the [Pelican Panel](https://pelican.dev).

## How to install plugins

[Download the repository archive](https://github.com/pelican-dev/plugins/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the folders of the plugins you want to install to your panels `plugins` folder (`/var/www/pelican/plugins` by default). Finally, open your panel and head to the plugins page and click on "Install".

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plugin folder and the plugin id need to match!  
> This means the plugin folder needs to be named the same as in this repo! (e.g. `player-counter` and _not_ `playercounter` or `plugins-player-counter`)

### Additional setup for themes

For themes you have to install Node.js 22+ and Yarn beforehand. Example:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - 
sudo apt install -y nodejs

npm i -g yarn
```
